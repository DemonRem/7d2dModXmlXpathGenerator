Project Title
7 Days To Die Mod Creator

About Me
Thanks for downloading my application! A little about me, former Java developer in California, now a Programming Teacher in France!
I developed this application while waiting for my first boy to be born, at the disdain of my lovely wife :) (due to the tremendous amount of time drilled to my computer) 
Honestly, with the new baby on the way we are struggling to make ends meet. If you like the app and are feeling generous, 
please don't hesitate to drop us a donation. And know, we would really appreciate it!

Good Luck with you mods and please don't forget to leave an endorsement if you like the app! 
Also, if you use this to create other mods Leave a link to my mod so other people can find it too.

Description
An xml object creation app (Future plans for full edit capabilities). It is designed as a mod editor for 7 days to die, however any
xml files can be loaded and created. The idea is to generate XPath to the target xml objects rather than editing and 
writing directly.

Executing program
Launch application

 - View loaded xml files in the right window tree
